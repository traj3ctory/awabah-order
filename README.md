# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Project setup

Install project with yarn

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/traj3ctory/awabah-order.git
    cd awabah-pizza
    yarn
    yarn start
```

- How do you document your frontend code?
```
- Descriptive function name
- Inline commenting
- Readme file

```
- What are your thoughts on testing for the front-end?
```
    Giving the required resources the necessary test should be carried out
```
- What Design Patterns have you used in your frontend projects?
```
- Modular architecture
```
- What do you think about Typescript on the front-end?
```
- I think typescript should be used as it reduces the number of error that occurs from typing. 
```
- What are the most important performance issues in React web applications?
```
- Redundant processing in components that do not update the DOM
- Updating leaf nodes that do not require updating
```
- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
```
- Redux : for global and easy state manipulation
- Component based development: easy to debug and reusable
```
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
```
- Improving the validation process in terms of restriction
- Improved UI design
```

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
